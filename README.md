# AI-Based-Cyber-Security-Threats-Prediction-AI-Agent

## 🔍 Project Statement: 
The project aims to develop agentic AI that acts as tireless guardians of network security. These AI agents will autonomously monitor network traffic, detect anomalies, and respond to cyber threats in real time without constant human oversight. This approach could significantly enhance an organization's security posture and free up human experts to focus on more complex security challenges.

## 🎯 Outcomes:

 * Autonomous monitoring of network traffic for enhanced security.
 * Real-time detection and response to cyber threats.
 * Reduction in the workload of human security experts.
 * Improved overall organizational resilience against digital threats.
